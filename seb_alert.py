"""
Discord Alert Monitor Script (Self Automation)
Author: desert.warfare

This is a script I made a while back, the story behind it is that I was part of a SWAT team in a roleplay game.
The idea behind it is whenever they needed SWAT ingame, they would tag us in a channel and ask us to hop in, however I would miss these tags because I don't check discord often.
Instead, this script would poll for any tags with keywords such as "requesting SWAT" and play a continous alarm sound and prompt me whether to confirm response and hop ingame.

This is one of my first Python scripts ever, so if it looks messy or not good, then I don't really care. As long as it worked for me, that was good enough until I received a warning from Discord.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: requests, pygame


WARNING: This script uses a user token, which is **against Discord's Terms of Service** for automation.
Using a user token for automation can result in your Discord account being permanently banned.
This script is intended for educational purposes only. **DO NOT** use it with your main Discord account. BETTER YET, use it with a bot or something.

For safe automation, consider using a **Discord bot** and the official [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.
